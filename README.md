# WorkPass 🚀  
### Turning Gig Work into Bank‑Trusted Income

WorkPass is a cross‑platform Flutter application that helps **gig workers prove income, stability, and trustworthiness** so they can gain access to real financial services such as **loans, BNPL, insurance, and banking products** — even without payslips or formal employment.

It also includes a **Bank Officer dashboard** to view worker risk profiles using a transparent scoring system called **WorkScore**.

## 🌟 Problem

Millions of gig workers earn consistently through platforms like:
- Swiggy, Zomato
- Uber, Ola

- lack of salary slips
- unverifiable work history

As a result, genuine workers are rejected or offered unfair interest rates.
